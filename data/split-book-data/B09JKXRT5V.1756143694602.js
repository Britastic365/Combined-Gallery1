window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Jonathan Harker visits Transylvania to help Count Dracula with the purchase of a house in London, he soon discovers some strange and shocking things about his new client. And then some strange things start happening back in England: an apparently unmanned ship is wrecked off the coast of Whitby, a young woman discovers strange puncture marks on her neck and the inmate of a lunatic asylum raves about the 'Master' and his imminent arrival. </p> <p>First published in 1897, Dracula is an epistolary novel, meaning that the narrative is related through letters, diary entries and newspaper articles. The story is brought to life in this Audible production by a group of actors that you might recognise from TV and film: Himesh Patel (<i>Yesterday</i>), Patricia Allison (<i>Sex Education</i>), Daisy Edgar-Jones (<i>Normal People</i>), Theo James (Divergent series) and Jason Watkins (<i>The Crown</i>). </p> <p>If youâ€™re in the mood for more gothic classics, check out <i>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i> performed by Pappa Essiedu and <i>Frankenstein</i> performed by Jamie Bell.</p>";
