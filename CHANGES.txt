Changes from original ALE
(in addition to what was required for me to package it)

8/25/25
1. Tried adding de-duplication to series-processing
    RESULT: Nothing changed
2. Added de-duplication to series in cleanup phase of content-script-app.vue
    RESULT: Success! No duplicate ASINs in series anymore!

I believe an ASIN was being added from both hotpotato.books AND from audible wishlist status,
when checking the book's status in my actual audible account.

8/24/25
1. Added getseriesdata to after getwishlistdata (after it's getstoredata) in src\content-script\content-script-app.vue
to fetch series data twice: after library book data retrieval and after wishlist book data retrieval.
    Result: nothing changed; plugin still worked, but no additional series data retrieved (or shown) in gallery.
2. Changed src\content-script\_components\_mixins\main-step\process-wishlist.js to save wishlist data to hotpotato.books instead of hotpotato.wishlist
because even though wishlist series data seems to be saved in the same place as library series, process-series-pages.js seems to be checking
series data against hotpotato.books and only processing series if a book appears in that file. Ony other thing added was to ensure
hotpotato.books was added to, not replaced, by wishlist data.  New possibility of duplicates was there but wanted to change things one by one
to isolate errors.
    Result: view at https://britastic365.github.io/Combined-Gallery1/#/library
             Successes:
             Actually accomplished a few things that I was trying to do, not just get more series data!
                -Wishlist books were added to library books data
                -The gallery display only shows the library page now, no wishlist at all
                -All wishlist books appear in library page, along with pricing information
                -Expanded series data was pulled (and is shown) for library and wishlist books, but in one series page, instead of separated
                -Wishlist books are only counted once in library gallery (so no duplicates shown there)
                -List of series correctly displays the number of books in the series that are actually in library/wishlist
             Problems:
                -Wishlist books are duplicated in SERIES information in book detail view; an example is:
                         Book Details Page - My Books in Series:
                         -Lists the correct series name, and the correct total number of books in the series, but incorrectly counts
                         the one book in the series (that's in the wishlist) twice, resulting in 2/3 books being counted as "my books"
                         -Lists 4 books in the series even though it correctly counts 3 total books in the series
                -Series Detail (when clicking on series in series table): Shows 2 rows for the same wishlist book
